# Logging in Go

Logs are chronological records of events that occur within a system. Logs capture detailed information about individual actions, errors, and states, providing context for debugging and troubleshooting. They can be structured or unstructured and come in various formats.

## 1. Zap

## 2. OpenTelemetry

Zap writes logs locally (stdout, file, etc.) while OpenTelemetry logging expects log records to be emitted through its own LoggerProvider
